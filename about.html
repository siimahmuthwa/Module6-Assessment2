        <h2><u>About Us</u></h2>
        <p>We are a car company based in Durban South Africa.</p>
        <p>We take pride in selling excellent cars to our customers.</p>
        <p>Increasing the footprint through the growth of dealerships is a key focus area for Auto4Sale. These dealerships provide access to more than 1 500 pre-owned vehicles, making it easy for buyers to find the right make and model to meet their requirements. All vehicles are owned by Auto4Sale ensuring that customers can shop with peace of mind knowing that they are buying a good quality vehicle backed by one of SAs largest dealer groups.</p>
        <p>We conduct business as per the rules and regulations of the Motor Industry Ombudsman and are also registered with the Motor Industry Ombudsman Transaction Protected Project.</p>
        <p>All our car dealerships have Finance and Insurance Managers who are registered with the Financial Services Board (FSP6210) and the National Credit Regulator. They are therefore authorised to provide car finance advice and car insurance advice, as well as to arrange car financing services and car insurance packages when you are buying a car.</p>
        <p>Shopping for a vehicle no longer needs to be limited to the customer’s geographical area. Motorists can shop a wide variety of vehicles on the Motus Select website and have their vehicle delivered to their nearest dealership anywhere in South Africa.</p>
        <p>All pre-owned cars are subjected to a comprehensive check and the dealer will assist with the registration of the vehicle to the customer’s name, which means that apart from the inhouse checks, all used cars include a valid roadworthy certificate. The Motus used car quality control process eliminates the chances of any stolen or rebuilt vehicles being offered for sale.</p>
